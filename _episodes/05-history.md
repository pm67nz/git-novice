All right! So
we can save changes to files and see what we've changedâ€”now how
can we restore older versions of things?
Let's suppose we accidentally overwrite our file:

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
We will need to manufacture our own oxygen
~~~
{: .output}

We can put things back the way they were
by using `pijul revert`:

~~~
$ pijul revert
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
In file "~dracula/planets/mars.txt"

- Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
- The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
- But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
+ We will need to manufacture our own oxygen

Shall I revert this change? (1/1) [ynkad] 
~~~
{: .output}

As usual, answer "y" for Yes.  The other options are No, sKip, All, and Done.

~~~
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
~~~
{: .output}

`pijul reset` puts everything back as it should be according to the repository, in 
other words it discards any changes which have not yet been recorded.

But what if we have already saved the change?, then we will have to remove the 
the saved changes from the repository:

Let's make another change to `mars.txt`.

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
$ pijul diff
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
In file "~dracula/planets/mars.txt"

+ An ill-considered change

~~~
{: .output}

Now, we record that change:

~~~
$ pijul record -a -m "I am going to regret this"
$ pijul changes
~~~
{: .bash}

The patch has now gone from the repository, but the change still exists in the working copy, but we can 
revert that too:

~~~
$ pijul diff
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
In file "~dracula/planets/mars.txt"

+ An ill-considered change

~~~

~~~
$ pijul revert -a
$ cat mars.txt
